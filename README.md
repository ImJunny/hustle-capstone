### What is _Hustle_?
_Hustle_ is a mobile app that allows users to post and accept local/remote, one-and-done jobs. It takes inspiration from existing services such as Fiverr, TaskRabbit, Indeed, and more to promote a community of productivity. Unlike these services, Hustle aims to act as a social media platform, allowing users to both work _and_ hire. This makes it suitable for those who want to make money and advertise their skills to potential employers.

Because communication is heavily used in an app that deals with jobs, the regulation of sending sensitive information to others is crucial to ensure security. Unlike other services, _Hustle_ will strive to keep users safe by blocking sensitive information such as phone numbers, emails, addresses, and external accounts through an AI-based API. AI and machine learning will also be used to create algorithmic feeds and display relevant post results.

This document gives a brief overview of the functional and non-functional requirements of the app. Using this document for reference is not recommended as it is outdated or innacurate.

Other notes that pertain to the development of the project are included here aswell.

[UI Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/design/yOzrsA69FWQ9xCKhAqabVm/Hustle-UI?node-id=358-276&t=SlAIQGHa6kLXDYiT-1): This is the Figma file used to create UI wireframes for the app. Element sizes should not be used for accurate scale, but colors are.
