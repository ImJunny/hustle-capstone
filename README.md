### What is _Hustle_?
_Hustle_ is a social media platform that allows users to post and accept local/remote, one-and-done jobs. It takes inspiration from existing services such as Fiverr, TaskRabbit, Indeed, and more to promote a community of productivity. Unlike these services, Hustle aims to act as a social media platform, allowing users to both work _and_ hire, making it suitable for both those who want to work for others or hire others to complete tasks for them. Users can also list their own services to advertise their skills to potential employers. 

Because communication is heavily used in an app that deals with jobs, the regulation of sending sensitive information to others is important to ensure security. Users may want to send information such as phone numbers, emails, addresses, SSNs, and external accounts, which is not ideal in a social media platform. Unlike other services, _Hustle_ will strive to keep users safe by blocking these type of emssages. In order to do this, AI and machine learning will be implemented as an external API. AI and machine learning will also be used to include other features such as algorithmic feeds and relevant results.
